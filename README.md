# Extended calibration of olivine-spinel Al exchange thermometers (OSAT)

Python scripts for the new models of the olivine-spinel Al exchange thermometers (OSAT). 

## Installation
```pip install https://github.com/eazzzon/olspthermo.git```

## Requirement
`numpy`

`pandas`

`scipy`

`periodictable`

## Uninstallation
```pip uninstall olspthermo```

## Example

To quick run, navigate to the `example` folder, call the python script as:

```python
python example_calculation.py
```

or run through the jupiter file.

**DON'T** change the header/column name of the example excel template files. 

## Monte Carlo simulation for error progagation

We also provide a MC approach to progagate the analytical errors to the temperature estimation. an example is given by calling 

```
python example_mc.py
```

or run in the jupyter example.

## Excel Spreadsheet & Jupyter notebook

We also provide an excel spreadsheet (`OSAT.xlsx` ) and example notebook files to calculate temperature with all models. Error progagation will have to go with MC in python
